## Configuring Prometheus

This exporter works the same way as
[blackbox exporter](https://github.com/prometheus/blackbox_exporter). As
it uses a full browser to run the queries, The queries should
be done in bigger intervals and timeout should be set to a higher number.

In `prometheus.yaml the following settings should be enough:

```yaml
  - job_name: 'login_exporter'
    scrape_interval: 5m
    metrics_path: /probe
    relabel_configs:
      - source_labels: [__address__]
        target_label: __param_target
      - source_labels: [__param_target]
        target_label: instance
      - target_label: __address__
        replacement: 127.0.0.1:9980
    file_sd_configs:
    - refresh_interval: 2m
      files:
         - '/etc/prometheus/login_targets.json'
```

In `login_targets.json` the following settings would be enough:

```json
[
  {
    "labels": {
      "group": "apps",
      "host": "hostname",
      "ip": "ip_address",
      "job": "login_exporter"
    },
    "targets": [
      "target_which_is_defined_in_login.yml_before"
    ]
  }
]
```

## Development

This application is open-source and can be extended. This repository
is a mirror of our home owned repository, as a result the pull request
here can not be directly merged. But pull requests are still welcome. 
I will extract the patch and add it manually to our internal repo, when
it is acceptable patch. You still can fork this repository and add your 
changes too.

### Build

To build this application you need to install the needed requirements
first with go get. Dont forget to install chrome and chrome driver
as it was discussed above.

```bash
go get
go build -o ./login_exporter
```

Or if you want to create a binary for several platforms at once, you can
use the `go_build.sh` script.
